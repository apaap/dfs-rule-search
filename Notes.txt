GOAL: Create a version of the oscillator search which has D2- symmetry in place of D4+ and 
run a search for 3-cell oscillators with o$bo$o! as the starting pattern. This is likely to 
give a reasonable set of results in a grid size constrained by the stack size (actually, 
cells shouldn't be on the stack, but pop3osc segfaults when the cells array is too large).
Assuming mirror axis on y=0, then max_x=60, max_y=30, max_t=2000 is doable. The initial 
pattern should probably be placed near x=max_x/2.

TODO: The main things to change to relax the symmetry assumption are:
- The x_bound needs an x_bound_min and x_bound_max
- The cell iterators should loop over x from x_bound_min instead of from 0
- The two calls to transition_from_cells() should have the x==0 conditionals removed (they'll be redundant)
- Remove the 90deg rotation check
- And probably some of the backtracking tests need adjustment

Then I think the next step will be to support spaceships by testing equality with the gen=0 pattern after allowing for n
on-zero x displacement - similar to what you were doing with lifelib yesterday.
Obviously this only searches for orthogonal spaceships, but i think it's a good step before relaxing the y-symmetry as w
ell.

Should implement dynamic allocation of the cells array so that it isn't limited by
